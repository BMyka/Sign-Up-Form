I am working on a project as part of The Odin Project curriculum that requires me to use my beginner to intermediate level skills in HTML and CSS to create a sign-up form. I will be using this project to showcase my understanding of input types, form structure, form validation, regular expressions, and advanced CSS techniques. As I have done with previous projects, I will be planning and organizing my work using pencil and paper.
